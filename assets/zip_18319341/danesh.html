              Hajee Mohammad Danesh (1900–1986) was leading political activist of South Asia during British colonialism.[4] He was born in Sultanpur village in Dinajpur District. He obtained his M.A. in history from Aligarh Muslim University in 1931 and B.L. degree in 1932. In the 1930s, Danesh became active in the communist organisations of Bengal, especially the Bengal provincial organisation of the Communist Party of India. He was arrested twice in 1938 by the government of Bengal for his participation in the Tebhaga movement, an agitation in northern Bengal against zamindars landlords for landless peasants and sharecroppers who sought a greater share of the yield, most of which was surrendered to the zamindars. Danesh was one of the few Muslim communist leaders of the struggle, and worked to mobilise the Muslim peasantry in favour of the movement. In 1945, he joined the All India Muslim League, but was later expelled for his participation in the continuing Tebagha movement, and re-arrested by the Bengal government in 1946. After the partition of India and Bengal in 1947, Danesh remained in his home district of Dinajpur, which fell in Muslim-majority East Bengal, which became part of the newly created Muslim state of Pakistan. He died in Dhaka on 28 June 1986.
              Hajee Mohammad Danesh died on 28 June 1986, in Dhaka.[1] The Agricultural Extension Training Institute was renamed in his honor as the Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University.</p>

Danesh briefly left active politics, to work as a professor of law at the Dinajpur Surendranath College.[1]

                In 1958, Danesh was arrested after martial law was declared by the military regime of Ayub Khan. Danesh became a prominent critic of the Ayub Khan regime, attacking its suppression of democracy and for what he saw to be its pro-United States policies.[6] As vice-president of the NAP, Danesh opposed the six-point demand for autonomy for East Bengal put forth by the leader of the Awami League, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.[7] He criticized the six-points for autonomy as not addressing the issues and concerns of the peasants of East Bengal, and also claimed the existence of separatist designs aimed to separate East Pakistan from West Pakistan.[7] Danesh later resigned from the NAP, protesting against the leadership of Maulana Bhashani and specifically criticizing what Danesh perceived to be Bhashani's reluctance to agitate against the Ayub military regime.[8] Danesh's resignation was followed by the departure of many other leading NAP activists.[8]

                In post-independence Bangladesh, Danesh formed the Jatiya Ganamukti Union (JGU) in 1973.[1] However, when all political parties except the ruling Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL) of president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were banned, he joined BAKSAL and became a member of the central committee.[1] He revived the JGU in 1976 but abolished it again in 1980 to form the Ganatantrik Party. This party was amalgamated with the Jatiya Party of the then-president Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad in 1986.[1]
