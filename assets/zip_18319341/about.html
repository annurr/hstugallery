              <p>Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science & Technology University is the first Science and Technology University in the northern region of Bangladesh. It stands away from the urban Dinajpur and bustle at a beautiful and scenic location some 13km north of Dinajpur town by the side of the intercity highway that links Dinajpur to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University was established as an Agricultural Extension Training Institute (AETI) to award a three-year diploma in agriculture. The AETI was later upgraded to Hajee Mohammad Danesh Agricultural College in 1988 having an affiliation from the Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh. Then the college was upgraded to the status of a university renaming it as Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University. First batch of the students were admitted at that time (1999-2000 session). The Act of the University was passed on 8 July 2001 in the Jatio Shongsad (National Assembly) was followed by a gazette notification on 8 April 2002.</p>

                <h4>History</h4>
              </p>
              <p>Shortly after the death in May 2009 of M. A. Wazed Miah, a physicist and the husband of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the regents of the university announced that the campus's third academic building, to be built later that year, would be named in his honour.[5]

                On 16 April 2015, two students were killed during clashes between factions of the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student front of the ruling Awami League party. Two arrests were made in the case five years later.[6]
                
                Vice-Chancellor M. Abul Kashem was the target of a number of protests during his tenure. On 5 November 2018, students staged a sit-in over his handling of multiple sexual harassment complaints against two teachers.[7] Sixteen teachers went on strike in October 2020 alleging that Kashem had been out of his office and unreachable for seven months, leading to administrative paralysis.[8] Kashem, whose term was due to expire at the end of January 2021, fled campus two weeks early after jobseekers, who had besieged his official residence and cut off power and water to it, stormed the building and held him and his wife captive for six hours.[9]</p>
